# 20212 Competition
Microsoft Research provided Kaggle with the dataset for organizing a competition in 2012 to write an algorithm to classify whether images contain either a dog or a cat. “While random  guessing is the easiest form of attack, various forms of image recognition can allow an attacker to  make guesses that are better than random. There is enormous diversity in the photo database (a  wide variety of backgrounds, angles, poses, lighting, etc.), making accurate automatic  classification difficult.” (Kaggle, 2012).

# CAPTCHA
Web services are often protected with a challenge that is supposed to be easy for people to  solve, but difficult for computers. Such a challenge is called CAPTCHA, which stands for Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart. You probably  have been asked to identify images of bicycles, traffic lights, cats, dogs, etc. before having access to protected web services. “In an informal poll conducted many years ago, computer vision experts posited that a  classifier with better than 60% accuracy would be difficult without a major advance in the state of  the art.” (Kaggle, 2012) 

# Deep Learning
With deep learning, it is suggested that machine classifiers can score above 80% accuracy in this task, leaving CAPTCHA in danger of being cracked by deep learning networks.
